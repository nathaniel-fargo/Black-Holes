                    When large stars collapses, they form into a black hole. Stars collapse when they run out of nuclear fusion. When the radiation from the fusion stops, nothing is keeping the gravity from collapsing the star into a black hole. Smaller stars often turn into white dwarfs, which are what small stars like our sun turn into after they collapse, with not enough mass to become a black hole. Medium sized stars can turn into neutron stars, and when two neutron stars collide, they can often form black holes, as their combined mass is enough to make the switch to black holes. Some supermassive stars don't actually form black holes though. Stars that turn into supernovas instead of collapsing, explode, releasing debris and new elements throughout the galaxy. At the center of galaxies are also Super Massive Black Holes, and their sheer size makes it hard to pinpoint how they could've formed.
