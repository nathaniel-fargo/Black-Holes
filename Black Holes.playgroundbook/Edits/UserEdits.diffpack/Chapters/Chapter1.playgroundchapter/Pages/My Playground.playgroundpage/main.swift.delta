 You need to turn off 🚫 "Show Results" under the timer icon ⏰ near the bottom right of your screen or else this program will not work ❌ or it will function at a reduced speed 🐌
 
 I'm not totally sure why this happens, but I'm guessing it tries to log something that isn't loggable, or it logs way too much
 
 Thank you so much!
     Cheers
